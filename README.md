# Exheredrey

This is an ebuild-inspired library designed to be used for (paludis)[https://paludis.exherbo.org/] and (portage)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portage_(software)] package managers backends used in Exherbo Linux and Gentoo Linux or anything that can run shell/bash scripts

Inspired by Exherbo Linux this is expected to source the logic using libraries (exlibs) instead of writing logic per file like it is a tradition to Gentoo which is obviously more efficient to handle downstream

### Standards

#### Pass shellcheck
Current `exheres-0` (20122019) has multiple minor to major issues that doesn't pass shellcheck which is not acceptable in exheredrey.

#### Write docummentation
Neither of Gentoo nor Exherbo's docummentation is usefull for contributors which is not acceptable in exheredrey.

#### Oversanitization
TODO link Kreyrock contributing

#### Translate
TODO Everything is expected to be translated and linked to translate for crowd sourcing
